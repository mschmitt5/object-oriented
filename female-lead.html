    <h1>Female Lead</h1>
    <p>If I were to hire a strong female lead I would hire Zoe Bell.</p>
    <p>I'd like to mostly avoid choosing anyone because of looks if the main descriptor for the role is "strong." Zoe looks fine but she would also do her own stunts, which is my main motivation for hiring her as a strong female lead. As a stuntwoman, she has also worked on quite a few things that I've enjoyed such as <em>Xena</em> and <em>Kill Bill</em>. She's also worked with Quentin Tarantino as an actress on many of his more recent films as well as acting as herself in <em>Death Proof</em>.</p>
    <p>I'm essentially choosing her based on capability, familiarity, and general badassness.</p>
